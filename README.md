# About Myself
![My photo](IMG_7060.jpg)
I am a master student at UC Davis in the Statistics department. Before this I was an undergraduate student at [Xi'an Jiao Tong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in the Mathematics and Statistics Department. I hold a Bachelor degree in Mathematics from Xi'an Jiao Tong University. I do not have specific researches now but I feel machine learning is interesting. 

I am from China and my hometwon is Xi'an. It is a city with rich culture and many historical sites. It is the starting point of the Silk Road and home to the [Terracotta Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army) of [Emperor Qin Shi Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Shi_Huang). It is an amazing place and is worthy to have a look. Welcome to Xi'an!

In this course, students learn the concepts and gain experience in using fundamental technologies for data sciences.
## Some topics in class
### Image Processing
Image processing is processing of images using mathematical operations by using any form of signal processing for which the input is an image, a series of images, or a video, such as a photograph or video frame; the output of image processing may be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image.
 
We did some basic thing about this topic. [Details](https://github.com/mengyeliu/myliu.github.io/blob/master/assignment2.ipynb)
### Natural language processing (NLP)
NLP is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages and, in particular, concerned with programming computers to fruitfully process large natural language corpora.

We download scrape text from The California Aggie and then analyze the text. [Details](https://github.com/mengyeliu/myliu.github.io/blob/master/assignment5.ipynb)

### Structured Query Language(SQL)
SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

We did some basic thing with some data sets of San Francisco. [Details](https://github.com/mengyeliu/myliu.github.io/blob/master/assignment6.ipynb)
## Project
Our project is about Trump's tweets and we did some analysis about his twitter data. [Project](https://kevinxucong.github.io/141B/)
